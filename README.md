# NoSQLProject

The goal of this project is to practice a NoSQL database. To achieve this objective, our project aims at exploring and querying a selection of New York open data(https://nycopendata.socrata.com/data) in order to find the best place to live in this city. To do so, we must have first have to choose a NoSQL database and load in it a set of open data which would allow us to answer to this question.
